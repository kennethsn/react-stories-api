The other photos featured here of 17 Madison Square are from 1905, when the former Yale Club was taken up by the The Women’s University Club.  The photos give an idea as to what the interior of the Club might have looked like in our tenure. In addition to the rooms pictured here, the club also housed a billiards room in the basement.",

The photos in the article give us a good idea of how The Yale Club might have looked from 1897-1901.\n\nThe Clubhouse at 17 Madison Square North was four stories with a basement, which housed the billiards room. We know, from the Archives, that the first floor of the clubhouse contained a large reading room, dining rooms, and a smoking room. In 1905, in The Woman’s University Club, this is what these rooms looked like. \n\n The bay window featured on page 1112 corresponds with the bay window shown in the facade of the building. This was probably one of the smaller dining rooms on the 2nd floor which were used for private dinners and class dinners, announcements for which showed up frequently in The Alumni Weekly.",
